Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a C++ program to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word in each step must be in the dictionary. Example:

              Input: DAMP, LIKE
              Output: DAMP->LAMP->LIMP->LIME->LIKE

A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing on top of each otherâ€™s shoulders. Each person must be shorter and lighter than the person below them. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a C++ program to determine the largest possible number of people in the tower.
